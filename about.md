I'm a data reporter with WBEZ in Chicago. This blog is a place to put down what I'm working on and what I'm learning each week as I try and improve my development skills.

Before WBEZ I worked as a reporter in Oregon, where I went to college. I'm a native of the East Bay Area, and still consider mysef a California though I haven't lived there in more than a decade.
